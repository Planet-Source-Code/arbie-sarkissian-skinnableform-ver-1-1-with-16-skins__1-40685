  ctrl_ListObject.ocx is one of the SKinableForm project ActiveX control members that gives you a pawerfull and handsome features.
  Its use is very simple. Simply add a ListObject ActiveX control to your VB project. This control automaticly set the SkinPath property to:

  [Current Dir]\Titanium 

Which is the default skin. Now you can use AddItem property to add a item to ListObject control:

  Private Sub Form_Load()
     Call Form1.ctrl_ListObject1.AddItem("Itam #1")
  End Sub

  To change the skin, you should enter the skin folder path (which contains skin files) that you want to chose in the SkinPath property.
  Forecolor property changes item's forecolor. MouseMoveColor sets item's forecolor while mouse is its over, and MouseDownColor sets item's forecolor while mouse button is pressed.
  It was a brief tutorial of using SkinableButton.
