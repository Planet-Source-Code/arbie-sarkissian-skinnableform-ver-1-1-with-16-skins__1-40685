  ctrl_ChannelBar.ocx is one of the SKinableForm project ActiveX control members that gives you a pawerfull and very hadsome features.
  Its use is very simple. Simply add a ChannelBar ActiveX control to your VB project. This control automaticly set the SkinPath property to:

  [Current Dir]\Titanium 

  Which is the default skin. Now you can use AddItem procedure to add a item to ListObject control:

  Private Sub Form_Load()
    Call Form1.ctrl_ListObject1.AddItem("Item #1")
    Call Form1.ctrl_ListObject1.AddItem("Item #2")
  End Sub

  And AddSubItem procedure to add a subitem to a specify item:

  Private Sub ctrl_ChannelBar1_Click(Index As Integer)
      Select Case Index
          Case 1:
              Call Form1.ctrl_ChannelBar1.AddSubItem("SubItem #1")
              Call Form1.ctrl_ChannelBar1.AddSubItem("SubItem #2")
          Case 2:
              Call Form1.ctrl_ChannelBar1.AddSubItem("SubItem #3")
      End Select
  End Sub

  To change the skin, you should enter the skin folder path (which contains skin files) that you want to chose in the SkinPath property.
  Forecolor Property sets the ListObject item's forecolor. MouseDownColor sets the item's forecolor after MouseDown event and MouseMoveColor set's item's forecolor when MouseMove event occurs.
  It was a brief tutorial of using ListObject.
